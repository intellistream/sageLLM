"""
Control Plane for sageLLM - Intelligent request routing and scheduling layer.

The Control Plane sits between users and vLLM execution instances, providing:
- Intelligent request routing and load balancing
- Advanced scheduling policies (priority, SLO-aware, cost-optimized)
- Dynamic parallelism strategy selection and optimization
- Multi-instance management and coordination
- Performance monitoring and adaptive optimization
