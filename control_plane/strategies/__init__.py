"""Scheduling strategies module.

This module provides various scheduling strategies for the Control Plane.
Each strategy implements the SchedulingPolicy interface defined in policies.py.

Available strategies:
- FIFOPolicy: First-In-First-Out scheduling
- PriorityPolicy: Priority-based scheduling
- SLOAwarePolicy: SLO deadline-aware scheduling
- CostOptimizedPolicy: Cost-optimized scheduling
- AdaptivePolicy: Adaptive strategy selection
